# Learning Ansible

This repository stores example code for the blog [Learning Ansible](https://www.learningansible.com).  I've separated out examples into separate directories, each highlighting different aspects of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

Though technically not required, [I recommend installing the Python packages into a virtual environment using virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv).  Using a virtual environment allows projects to maintain different versions of Python modules without conflict.

Each directory will have its own README.md that will illustrate how best to proceed with examples.
